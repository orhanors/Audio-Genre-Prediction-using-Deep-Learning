# Audio Genre Prediction using Deep Learning

This project explains how to predict music genre using CNN deep learning architecture.

Main purpose of this project is explaning how CNN architecture can handle with audio files. So, please read this [PAPER](https://github.com/orhanors/Audio-Genre-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning/blob/master/Audio-Genre-Classification/Paper.pdf) to learn details under project structure

## Requirements

|Package|Used For|
|---|---|
|[Tensorflow](https://github.com/cython/cython) | CNN architecture using _keras_ module.|
|[Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)|Handling audio data.|
|[scikitlearn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)|Python wrapper for rubberband, a perfectly capable time stretcher & pitch shifter.|

## About Dependencies

The project includes **trained model** which was created by GTZAN dataset. 

Recently, dataset web page crushed. You can work with [this](https://github.com/orhanors/Audio-Genre-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning/tree/master/Audio-Genre-Classification/my_model) trained model.
